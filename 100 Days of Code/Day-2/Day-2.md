## Day Two - Data Types and Manipulating Strings

---

<p align = center><b>Data Types</b></p>

**Strings**
Strings are a set of characters surrounded by quotation marks.

```python
"Hello, this is a string."
```
**Subscripting**
Selecting a character in a string using [] with the number of the character in the string. The first character in a string is always 0.

```python
print("Hello"[0])
```
Would print the H character since it is the first character in the string.
```
H
```
```python
print("Hello"[4])
```
Would print o since it is the fourth character in the string.
```
o
```
- "12345" would still be treated as a string rather than a number. Anything surrounded by quotes is a string.

**Integer**
A set of whole numbers not surrounded by quotations. 12345 is an integer "12345" is not.

- To make large numbers easier to read, you can put an underscore between integers and the computer will still treat it as one number. 123_456_789 is the same as 123456789.

**Float**
A set of numbers with a decimal point (the decimal point can "float" to any place in a number). 123.456 for example

**Boolean**
A data type with only two possible values. True or False. The first character is always capitalized on True or False. Used to evaluate if an expression is True or False.
