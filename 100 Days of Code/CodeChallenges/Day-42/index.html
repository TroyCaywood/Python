        <p><em><strong>Aspiring</strong> Programmer</em></p>
        <p>I have been in the IT field for a little over 15 years. I started out on helpdesk, and I am currently a
        Systems Administrator. I have experience with a wide array of technologies, and I am trying to add programming
        to that list.</p>
