# Day 6 - Python Functions


## Functions
- A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result.
- Python has many [built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) for example:
  + int()
  + print()
  + range()
  + str()

**Defining and calling python functions**
- To defined a function, you use def functionname(input parameter, input parameter): followed by what you want the function to do.
- To call the function you would just type the function name and the parameters you want to pass to the function.

```python
#Define function name and parameters
def my_function():
  # Do this
  print("Hello)
  # Now do this
  print("Bye)

# Call the function
my_function()

# Function would output this:
Hello
Bye
```
