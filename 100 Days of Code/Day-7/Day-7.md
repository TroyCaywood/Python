# Day 7 - Hangman

- Today we will be building a hangman game. This is a fun project and I would encourage you to do the project yourself before reading this page.

**Breaking down problems into flowcharts**

- Before starting a project, it's a good idea to break down your program into a flowchart.

For example we could flowchart our game of hangman like this:

<img width="500" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52113778/206577471-61f8eaf2-bbdb-4867-a89e-fe3cbde0baf8.png">

- First we need to build a way to select a random word from a list, break that word up into separate letters, prompt the user for input, and then compare that input to the selected random word.

```python
#Step 1 
word_list = ["aardvark", "baboon", "camel"]

#TODO-1 - Randomly choose a word from the word_list and assign it to a variable called chosen_word.
import random

chosen_word = random.choice(word_list)
print(chosen_word)

#TODO-2 - Ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess. Make guess lowercase.
guess = input("Choose a letter"\n).lower()


#TODO-3 - Check if the letter the user guessed (guess) is one of the letters in the chosen_word.
for word in chosen_word:
  if word == guess:
    print("Right")
  else:
    print("Wrong")
```

- Now we need to change our code so it displays blanks instead of the letters in the chosen word and then replaces those blanks with the player's guess if it's correct
```python
#Step 2

import random
word_list = ["aardvark", "baboon", "camel"]
chosen_word = random.choice(word_list)

#Testing code
print(f'Pssst, the solution is {chosen_word}.')

#TODO-1: - Create an empty List called display.
#For each letter in the chosen_word, add a "_" to 'display'.
#So if the chosen_word was "apple", display should be ["_", "_", "_", "_", "_"] with 5 "_" representing each letter to guess.
guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()
display = []
word_length = len(chosen_word)

for letter in chosen_word:
  display += "_"

#TODO-2: - Loop through each position in the chosen_word;
#If the letter at that position matches 'guess' then reveal that letter in the display at that position.
#e.g. If the user guessed "p" and the chosen word was "apple", then display should be ["_", "p", "p", "_", "_"].
for position in range(word_length):
  letter = chosen_word[position] 
  if letter == guess:
    display[position] = guess


#TODO-3: - Print 'display' and you should see the guessed letter in the correct position and every other letter replace with "_".
#Hint - Don't worry about getting the user to guess the next letter. We'll tackle that in step 3.
print(display)
```
Now we need to add a while loop so we can check if the player has guessed all the letters and prompt them to guess again if they either didn't guess a correct letter or the game isn't over.
```python
#Step 3

import random
word_list = ["aardvark", "baboon", "camel"]
chosen_word = random.choice(word_list)
word_length = len(chosen_word)

#Testing code
print(f'Pssst, the solution is {chosen_word}.')

#Create blanks
display = []
for _ in range(word_length):
    display += "_"

#TODO-1: - Use a while loop to let the user guess again. The loop should only stop once the user has guessed all the letters in the chosen_word and 'display' has no more blanks ("_"). Then you can tell the user they've won.
end_of_game = False

while not end_of_game:
    guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()

    #Check guessed letter
    for position in range(word_length):
        letter = chosen_word[position]
        #print(f"Current position: {position}\n Current letter: {letter}\n Guessed letter: {guess}")
        if letter == guess:
            display[position] = letter

    print(display)

    #Check if there are no more "_" left in 'display'. Then all letters have been guessed.
    if "_" not in display:
        end_of_game = True
        print("You win.")
'''

Now we need to add a lose condition and add a way to check how many lives are left as well as adding the hangman art.

```python
#Step 4

import random

stages = ['''
  +---+
  |   |
  O   |
 /|\  |
 / \  |
      |
=========
''', '''
  +---+
  |   |
  O   |
 /|\  |
 /    |
      |
=========
''', '''
  +---+
  |   |
  O   |
 /|\  |
      |
      |
=========
''', '''
  +---+
  |   |
  O   |
 /|   |
      |
      |
=========''', '''
  +---+
  |   |
  O   |
  |   |
      |
      |
=========
''', '''
  +---+
  |   |
  O   |
      |
      |
      |
=========
''', '''
  +---+
  |   |
      |
      |
      |
      |
=========
''']

end_of_game = False
word_list = ["ardvark", "baboon", "camel"]
chosen_word = random.choice(word_list)
word_length = len(chosen_word)

#TODO-1: - Create a variable called 'lives' to keep track of the number of lives left. 
#Set 'lives' to equal 6.
lives = 6

#Testing code
print(f'Pssst, the solution is {chosen_word}.')

#Create blanks
display = []
for _ in range(word_length):
    display += "_"

while not end_of_game:
    guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()

    #Check guessed letter
    for position in range(word_length):
        letter = chosen_word[position]
       # print(f"Current position: {position}\n Current letter: {letter}\n Guessed letter: {guess}")
        if letter == guess:
            display[position] = letter

    #TODO-2: - If guess is not a letter in the chosen_word,
    #Then reduce 'lives' by 1. 
    #If lives goes down to 0 then the game should stop and it should print "You lose."
    if guess not in chosen_word:
        lives -= 1
        if lives == 0:
            end_of_game = True
            print("You lose.")

    #Join all the elements in the list and turn it into a String.
    print(f"{' '.join(display)}")

    #Check if user has got all letters.
    if "_" not in display:
        end_of_game = True
        print("You win.")

    #TODO-3: - print the ASCII art from 'stages' that corresponds to the current number of 'lives' the user has remaining.
    print(stages[lives])
```

Finally we clean up the game by importing the word list and ASCII art as modules and adding more user feedback when a letter has been used already or they guessed wrong:
```python
#Step 5

import random

#TODO-1: - Update the word list to use the 'word_list' from hangman_words.py
#Delete this line: word_list = ["ardvark", "baboon", "camel"]
from hangman_words import word_list

chosen_word = random.choice(word_list)
word_length = len(chosen_word)

end_of_game = False
lives = 6

#TODO-3: - Import the logo from hangman_art.py and print it at the start of the game.
from hangman_art import logo
print(logo)

#Testing code
print(f'Pssst, the solution is {chosen_word}.')

#Create blanks
display = []
for _ in range(word_length):
    display += "_"

while not end_of_game:
    guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()

    #TODO-4: - If the user has entered a letter they've already guessed, print the letter and let them know.
    if guess in display:
        print(f"You've already guessed {guess}")

    #Check guessed letter
    for position in range(word_length):
        letter = chosen_word[position]
        #print(f"Current position: {position}\n Current letter: {letter}\n Guessed letter: {guess}")
        if letter == guess:
            display[position] = letter

    #Check if user is wrong.
    if guess not in chosen_word:
        #TODO-5: - If the letter is not in the chosen_word, print out the letter and let them know it's not in the word.
        print(f"You guessed {guess}, that's not in the word. You lose a life.")
        
        lives -= 1
        if lives == 0:
            end_of_game = True
            print("You lose.")

    #Join all the elements in the list and turn it into a String.
    print(f"{' '.join(display)}")

    #Check if user has got all letters.
    if "_" not in display:
        end_of_game = True
        print("You win.")

    #TODO-2: - Import the stages from hangman_art.py and make this error go away.
    from hangman_art import stages
    print(stages[lives])
```
