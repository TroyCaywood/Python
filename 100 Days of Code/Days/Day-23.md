# Day 23 - The Turtle Crossing Capstone Project

- Todays project was to build a frogger clone using turtle. It was mainly self guided with a few hints.

# Day 23 [Code Challenge](https://github.com/TroyCaywood/Python/tree/main/100%20Days%20of%20Code/CodeChallenges/Day-23) - This is my solution and I had to use a couple hints. See if you can do it with no hints!
