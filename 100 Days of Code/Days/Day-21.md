# Day 21 - Build the Snake Game Part 2: Inheritance and List Slicing

- Today we are going to finish creating the classic [snake game](https://www.playsnake.org) in python
- Yesterday we completed the first 3 steps and will work on the remaining steps today:
   + ~~Create the snake body out of 3 squares on the screen lined up next to each other~~
   + ~~Tell the snake to move forwards constantly~~
   + ~~Create controls to move the snake~~
   + Put food on the screen and detect collision between the snake and food and then get rid of that piece of food and create it again in a new random location
   + Create a scoreboard to keep score
   + Create a game over situation when the snake hits the wall
   + Game over when the snake hits itself
