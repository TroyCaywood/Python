# Day 11 - Blackjack Capstone Project

- Today there were no notes to take. It was all working on a blackjack game. It was a pretty fun project!

## Day 11 [Code Challenge](https://github.com/TroyCaywood/Python/blob/main/100%20Days%20of%20Code/CodeChallenges/Day-11/Day_11-BlackJack.py) 
- You should really attempt this on your own before clicking. Try  to complete it with as few hints as possible. My code didn't match what the instructor did completely, and I had to watch two hint videos. It's a hard challenge, but you can do it!
