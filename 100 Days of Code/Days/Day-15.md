# Day 15 - Local Development Environment Setup and Coffee Machine Project

- Today's lecture was all about setting up a local development environment using Pycharm and Python
- Using a local IDE is much better than using a web based editor such as replit since it has many more features




## Day 15 [Code Challenge](https://github.com/TroyCaywood/Python/blob/main/100%20Days%20of%20Code/CodeChallenges/Day-15/Day_15-CoffeMachine.py) - Coffee Machine - Do NOT click until you've tried this project yourself. It's harder than the previous projects, but you can do it!
