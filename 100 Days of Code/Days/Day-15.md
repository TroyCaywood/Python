# Day 15 - Local Development Environment Setup and Coffee Machine Project

- Today's lecture was all about setting up a local development environment using Pycharm and Python
- Using a local IDE is much better than using a web based editor such as replit since it has many more features
- Download and install the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for your operating system. Install using default selections.
- Download and in stall the latest version of [Pycharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac). Install using default selections.
- You could use something like Visual Studio Code too, but this course uses Pycharm.
